## Enhanced Mental Health Monitoring Using NLP and RNN Techniques

The project aims to analyze text data to detect emotions and monitor mental health patterns. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning models like RNN and LSTM, the system identifies emotional fluctuations, providing valuable insights for early mental health intervention.

## About

The project focuses on utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning models to analyze textual data for mental health assessment. By employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the system effectively captures emotional patterns and detects mood fluctuations over time. It processes user-generated text, identifies underlying sentiments, and classifies emotional states to support early intervention strategies. The project also incorporates data visualization techniques to highlight trends and insights for better understanding. A Django-based web application integrates the model, offering users real-time feedback on their emotional well-being.
